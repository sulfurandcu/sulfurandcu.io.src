The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things, the honors are unreal to me. I don’t believe in honors, it bothers me, honors bother, honors is epaulettes, honors is uniforms. My papa brought me up this way. I can’t stand it, it hurts me.

It's really ironic.
