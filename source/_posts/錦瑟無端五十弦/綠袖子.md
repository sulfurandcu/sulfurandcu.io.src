<br>

Greensleeues was all my ioy,
⁠Greensleeues was my delight:
Greensleeues was my hart of gold,
⁠And who but Ladie Greensleeues.

<br>

Alas my loue, ye do me wrong,
⁠to cast me off discurteously:
And I haue loued you so long,
⁠Delighting in your companie.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy,
⁠Greensleeues was my delight:
⁠Greensleeues was my heart of gold,
⁠And who but Ladie Greensleeues.

I haue been readie at your hand,
⁠to grant what euer you would craue.
I haue both waged life and land,
⁠your loue and good will for to haue.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

I bought thee kerchers to thy head,
⁠that were wrought fine and gallantly:
I kept thee both at boord and bed,
⁠Which cost my purse wel fauouredly,
⁠Greensleeues was al my ioie, &c.

I bought thee peticotes of the best,
⁠the cloth so fine as fine might be:
I gaue thee iewels for thy chest,
⁠and all this cost I spent on thee.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioie, &c.

Thy smock of silk, both faire and white,
⁠with gold embrodered gorgeously:
Thy peticote of Sendall right:
⁠and thus I bought thee gladly.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioie, &c.

Thy girdle of gold so red,
⁠with pearles bedecked sumptuously:
The like no other lasses had,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me,
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Thy purse and eke thy gay guilt kniues,
⁠thy pincase gallant to the eie:
No better wore the Burgesse wiues,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Thy crimson stockings all of silk,
⁠with golde all wrought aboue the knee,
Thy pumps as white as was the milk,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Thy gown was of the grossie green,
⁠thy sleeues of Satten hanging by:
Which made thee be our haruest Queen,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Thy garters fringed with the golde,
⁠And siluer aglets hanging by,
Which made thee blithe for to beholde,
⁠And yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

My gayest gelding I thee gaue,
⁠To ride where euer liked thee,
No Ladie euer was so braue,
⁠And yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

My men were clothed all in green,
⁠And they did euer wait on thee
Al this was gallant to be seen,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

They set thee vp, they took thee downe,
⁠they serued thee with humilitie,
Thy foote might not once touch the ground,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

For euerie morning when thou rose,
⁠I sent thee dainties orderly:
To cheare thy stomack from all woes,
⁠and yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing.
⁠But stil thou hadst it readily:
Thy musicke still to play and sing,
⁠And yet thou wouldst not loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

And who did pay for all this geare,
⁠that thou didst spend when pleased thee?
Euen I that am reiected here,
⁠and thou disdainst to loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Wel, I wil pray to God on hie,
⁠that thou my constancie maist see:
And that yet once before I die,
⁠thou wilt vouchsafe to loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, c.

Greensleeues now farewel adue
⁠God I pray to prosper thee:
For I am stil thy louer true,
⁠come once againe and loue me.
⁠Greensleeues was all my ioy, &c.

Finis.
